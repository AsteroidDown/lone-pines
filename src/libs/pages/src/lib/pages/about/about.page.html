      "Touching on inspiration ranging from the retro feelings of Electric Light
      Orchestra to the modern vibes of Bon Iver, lone pines stands out from the
      local Vancouver indie scene."
    </h2>

    <p>
      Lone pines members Callum Follett and Braden Williams first met in high
      school band class, knowing that there was musical potential between them.
      After performing under different monikers for the past 8 years, they
      settled on lone pines and released their first single You Are in late
      2020.
    </p>

    <p>
      The nostalgic vibes and chilling vocals garnered over 1000 views on
      YouTube and over 10,000 plays on Spotify. After success from their
      latest single Boys in LA, the band is excited to release their first full
      length album February 2023:

      Dancing In the Cosmos by lone pines is more than just indie rock. It's a musical odyssey that follows an alien on
      a journey through space, and its themes speak directly to the human experience. From the upbeat and catchy
      "Something New" to the more introspective "Say it out Loud," the album explores the emotions and sounds of a
      being lost in a strange new world. lone pines' ability to blend different genres into their music is on full
      display in tracks like "Runaway" and "Canâ€™t Get Enough of You," which seamlessly merge indie rock with elements
      of pop and electronic music.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alien's journey through space and its encounters with different worlds and cultures is a metaphor for our own
      journey through life. The album speaks to the feelings of alienation we experience in a world dominated by
      capitalism, as well as the interpersonal relationships we navigate in our daily lives. Dancing In the Cosmos is a
      testament to the power of music to tell a story, and lone pines' ability to weave a narrative through their songs
      is a true testament to their talent as musicians.
