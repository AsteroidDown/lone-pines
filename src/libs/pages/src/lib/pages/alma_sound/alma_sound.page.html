      "Touching on inspiration ranging from the retro feelings of Electric Light
      Orchestra to the modern vibes of Bon Iver, lone pines stands out from the
      local Vancouver indie scene."
    </h2>

    <p>
      Lone pines members Callum Follett and Braden Williams first met in high
      school band class, knowing that there was musical potential between them.
      After performing under different monikers for the past 8 years, they
      settled on lone pines and released their first single You Are in late
      2020.

      The nostalgic vibes and chilling vocals garnered over 1000 views on
      YouTube and over 10,000 plays on Spotify. After success from their
      latest single Boys in LA, the band is excited to release their first full
      length album in early 2023.
